 # Solving Constraints Part 1
 In this playground, the minesweeper is preset to have a few constraints. There is a very power constraint solver hint which you can get by pressing the Yellow light button on the top right. You should be able to solve all the constraints and win without guessing. Keep track of the number of mines in the minefield, and in some cases it will give a hint on where the remaining mines are.
