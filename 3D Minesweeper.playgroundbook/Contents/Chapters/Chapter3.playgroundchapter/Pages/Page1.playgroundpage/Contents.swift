 # Solving Constraints Part 1
 In this playground, the minesweeper is preset with a few constraints. You should be able to solve all the constraints and win without guessing. There are a few 3D constraints on the edges. You can also use the constraint solver (hint()) by pressing the Yellow light button on the top right. To get an idea how the constraints work, use the hint as the first pass to solve the minesweeper cube.
